# WhatsApp Message Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

The reason why I choose WhatsApp as my analysis is because I always wanted to know more about my chat room behaviour.In this project, I will attempt to find out what normally I will do in a group chat with my friends such as the active hours we usually talk and the number of emoji we use in the chat and answer the following questions.

Which users have the most Chat/messages in the group?
Which emojis use the most by which users?
Most active hours?
Which month have the highest messages and also the busiest month?
Determine which word or text did the user use the most?
